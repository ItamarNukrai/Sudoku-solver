This project is a sudoku solver, it uses java Swing GUI to visualy see the grid. 
I used algorithms to solve the sudoku, and if they can not solve it (if the sudoku level is the hardest), generate a random number in a random Tile.
When clicking the solve button, it solve the sudoku in 2- 5 seconds.
the black numbers are the human numbers, the red and green are the computer ones (green is all the numbers generated form the random tile, and red is from the algorithms in genaralDel methood in each Tile.
when running the program, the grid will have black numbers, this is a sudoku you can solve without needed to input the numbers one by one, to disable it, go to the methood in the MyPanel class and comment setPreGameLevel2() method.
to move between tiles, use the arrows keys.
have fun!
